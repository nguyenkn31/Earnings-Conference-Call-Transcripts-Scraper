# Introduction:
I used this to scrape the earnings conference call transcripts from SeekingAlpha. What I did was scrape the links of the transcripts' websites first, then use another function to scrape the contents of those links directly. I set a random wait time on each website to avoid suspicion. The scraping alone will take roughly 2-3 days to complete, probably more now considering that I created this project a while ago.

# Technology:
The language is Python, and I utlize Selenium mainly for scraping.

# Disclaimer:
Please use this at your own discretion - scraping is not allowed on SeekingAlpha, this is purely for testing and informational.
